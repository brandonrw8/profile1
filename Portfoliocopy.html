            My name is Brandon and I'm from Sussex County, New Jersey.
            As a career I want to be an architect, I've always liked drawing 
            buildings and structures since I was little. In my free time I 
            like to  hike and go boating. I currently work for the New Jersey
            division of Parks and Forestry, which I enjoy as a part time job.
